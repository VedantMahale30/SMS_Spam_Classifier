# SMS_Spam_Classifier
The SMS spam classifier project aims to build a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between spam and legitimate (non-spam) messages in SMS (Short Message Service) texts. The project's primary objective is to create an automated system that can accurately classify incoming text messages as either spam or not spam, also known as ham.

The proliferation of mobile devices and text messaging has led to an increase in spam messages, which can be annoying, deceptive, or even harmful to users. By developing a robust spam classifier, we can help users filter out unwanted messages, allowing them to focus on essential communications and improve their overall messaging experience.

The typical workflow of the SMS spam classifier project involves the following steps:

#Data Collection: Gather a labeled dataset containing SMS messages categorized as spam or ham. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the classifier.

#Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data to remove noise, such as special characters, punctuation, and convert the text to a standard format. Common preprocessing steps include tokenization (splitting text into individual words or tokens), stopword removal (removing common words like "and," "the," etc.), and stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).

#Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data that will be used to represent the SMS messages numerically. This could involve techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings.

#Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm to build the SMS spam classifier. Commonly used algorithms include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or even more advanced techniques like deep learning with neural networks.

#Model Training: Split the preprocessed dataset into training and validation sets. Train the chosen model on the training data, adjusting its internal parameters to minimize classification errors.

#Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model on a separate test dataset. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

#Model Tuning and Validation: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and validate its performance to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization to new, unseen data.

#Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to a production environment, where it can classify incoming SMS messages as spam or ham in real-time.
