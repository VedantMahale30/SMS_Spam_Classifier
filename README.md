# SMS_Spam_Classifier
The SMS spam classifier project aims to build a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between spam and legitimate (non-spam) messages in SMS (Short Message Service) texts. The project's primary objective is to create an automated system that can accurately classify incoming text messages as either spam or not spam, also known as ham.

The proliferation of mobile devices and text messaging has led to an increase in spam messages, which can be annoying, deceptive, or even harmful to users. By developing a robust spam classifier, we can help users filter out unwanted messages, allowing them to focus on essential communications and improve their overall messaging experience.
